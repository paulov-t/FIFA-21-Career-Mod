	- Player movement between countries is based upon real-world data of player nationalities in each league
- Free Agents
	- Free Agents wont just play for any team, there will be no more picking up gems from the Free Agent market with a poor team

	- The AI will actively replace all lost players
	- The AI will always want to improve their team
	- The AI is much less likely to stack in a position (WORK IN PROGRESS)

- Player Values have been adjusted to be more like transkermarkt.com
